    <h2>List of Projects created</h2>
      <p>After pre-prep at Moringa School, I was priviledged to proceed to prep.
         Prep started a week ago and it's far different from pre-prep and that was a shock for me,
         the content was so much to cover in a day.We started with the terminal, installing atom, 
         opened up an account on GitHub. Below is a list of links of the projects that I created.</p>
   <ol>
    <li><a  target ="_blank" href="https://github.com/angelakarenzi5/cookie-recipe.git">Cookie-recipe</a>
        <p>Cookie-recipe was created by ellenklehman. She used the html language, however, she didn't correctly indent her work and
            I was given the task to make sure she has the right indentation.
            Once you double click the Cookie-recipe navigation, it will show you the edited version. 
            Incorrect indentation won't affect the functionality of the webpage, but it is easy to have the right indentation 
            in order to be able to read your codes and understand them. Quality is one of the things we stand for here at Moringa School, 
            therefore a well indented page is evidence that you are a good software developer.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/angelakarenzi5/Pet-webpage.git">Pet-webpage</a>
        <p>Pet-webpage was created by html and the goal for this webpage was to polish ou html skills; 
            including the title, body, headers, lists using ul and ol, the main target was to highlight the difference between ul and ol;
            ul presenting lists in bullet points, whereas, ol presenting lists in the form of numbers, while writing out your code. It is important
            to know the difference in order to get a specific output of what you have in mind.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/angelakarenzi5/my-first-webpage.git">My-first-webpage</a>
      <p>My-first-webpage was created in html but the aim of this project was to include the README document, It's often the first thing someone new to your project
         sees and is frequently the only source of documentation. It gives a list of information and every repository has a different README file.
         It's important to have an organized and detailed README because if people see an incomplete or messy  README, they will assume your code is like that.
