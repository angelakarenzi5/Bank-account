    <h2>List of Projects created</h2>
      <p>After pre-prep at Moringa School, I was priviledged to proceed to prep.
         Prep started a week ago and it's far different from pre-prep and that was a shock for me,
         the content was so much to cover in a day.We started with the terminal, installing atom, 
         opened up an account on GitHub. Below is a list of links of the projects that I created.</p>
   <ol>
    <li><a  target ="_blank" href="https://github.com/angelakarenzi5/cookie-recipe.git">Cookie-recipe</a>
        <p>Cookie-recipe was created by ellenklehman. She used the html language, however, she didn't correctly indent her work and
            I was given the task to make sure she has the right indentation.
            Once you double click the Cookie-recipe navigation, it will show you the edited version. 
            Incorrect indentation won't affect the functionality of the webpage, but it is easy to have the right indentation 
            in order to be able to read your codes and understand them. Quality is one of the things we stand for here at Moringa School, 
            therefore a well indented page is evidence that you are a good software developer.</p>
