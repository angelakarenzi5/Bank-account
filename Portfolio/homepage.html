      <p>After pre-prep at Moringa School, I was priviledged to proceed to prep.
         Prep started a week ago and it's far different from pre-prep and that was a shock for me,
         the content was so much to cover in a day.We started with the terminal, installing atom, 
         opened up an account on GitHub. Below is a list of links of the projects that I created.</p>
